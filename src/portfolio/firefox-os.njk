        <p>
            Firefox OS was Mozillaâ€™s attempt to build a mobile operating system from web technologies. I joined the team to design the initial proof-of-concept, then stayed on as Interaction Design lead for versions 1 and 2. I am particularly proud of the "uniquely web" user experience we^[<a href="https://gordonbrander.com">Gordon Brander</a> and myself] defined for version 2. Our objective was the to bring the seamless feel of browsing the web to a mobile OS. The results anticipated features that would become standard in later verisons of Android and iOS, including edge gestures and system-wide search.

            Firefox OS ultimately failed in the market was discontinued, but it lives on today in <a href="https://www.kaiostech.com/">KaiOS</a> phones around the world, and in Panasonic smart TVs, both of which run on forks of the open source Firefox OS <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/B2G">core</a>.

    {# ----- B2G Screens ----- #}

    <p>
        Before Firefox OS became a real project, there was a proof-of-concept prototype, built hastily in advance of Mobile World Congress 2012 to show the world that a mobile operating system could be built on the web stack. I joined the effort to help create icons, and ended up designing the full interface. While <em>very</em> rushed (the home screen was slapped togther in one night in a hotel room in Paris) and dated, I think overall it holds up well.
