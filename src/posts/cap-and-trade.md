Specific variation: Revenue-neutral carbon tax. Money collected goes back to individuals. E.g. A yearly carbon dividend. And raise price over time so businesses increasingly incentivized to change behaviour, while also giving them time ramp to adjust.

## William Nordhaus

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nordhaus). Economist who was early in embracing carbon tax as preferred method of carbon pricing. 2018 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, "for integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis". Known for embracing lower carbon taxes per ton than most scientists.

Earlier work (e.g.Â 1993 paper "Rolling the Dice") recognized threat of global warming, but several underestimated the impact, and therefore was embraced by the deny-and-delay crowd.

> Nordhaus was recognized for his work developing a model to guide policymakers on how best to address the costs and benefits of limiting greenhouse gases. That's a noble goal, but Nordhaus' work has no more helped to defuse the threat of global warming than Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Germany prevented World War II. Rather, Nordhaus' low-ball estimates of the costs of future climate change and high-ball estimates of the costs of containing the threat contributed to a lost decade in the fight against climate change, lending intellectual legitimacy to denial and delay.

> In Nordhaus' 1993 paper, "Rolling the 'Dice': An Optimal Transition Path for Controlling Greenhouse Gases," he wrote: "A growing body of evidence has pointed to the likelihood that greenhouse warming will have only a modest economic impact in industrial countries, while progress to cut \[greenhouse gases\] will impose substantial costs." How modest? Nordhaus estimated that a 3 degrees Celsius warming would cost the U.S. economy a miniscule one-quarter percent of national income. He admitted that unmeasured and unquantifiable variables might affect that prediction, but in his view, they might only bring the cost up to about 1% of national income. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-author' title='Authors'>Linden, Eugene.</span> <span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-linden-nobel-economics-mistake-20181025-story.html'>The Economics Nobel Went to a Guy Who Enabled Climate Change Denial and Delay - Los Angeles Times</a>.</span> <span class='cite-container' title='Newspaper'>Los Angeles Times.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>25 Oct 2018.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 9 Nov 2019.</span></span>==

More recently has revised his models: "His most recent work implies an optimum tax on carbon at \$31 a ton, which, in real terms, is about three times his too-low 1992 estimate." ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-author' title='Authors'>Linden, Eugene.</span> <span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-linden-nobel-economics-mistake-20181025-story.html'>The Economics Nobel Went to a Guy Who Enabled Climate Change Denial and Delay - Los Angeles Times</a>.</span> <span class='cite-container' title='Newspaper'>Los Angeles Times.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>25 Oct 2018.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 9 Nov 2019.</span></span>==
