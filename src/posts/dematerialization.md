## Hypothesis

-   We can decouple economic growth from environmental degradation. Indeed, we're already seeing evidence around the world
-   Enabling forces are 1) efficiency, 2) technology, 3) environmentalism, 4) government regulation (see section below for additional details).

## Sources

Originally put forward by Jesse Ausubel in a 2015 Long Now talk, [Nature is Rebounding](http://longnow.org/seminars/02015/jan/13/nature-rebounding-land-and-ocean-sparing-through-concentrating-human-activities/), and then fleshed out in a subsequent essay, [The Return of Nature: How Technology Liberates the Environment](https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/issue-5/the-return-of-nature). Andrew McAfee was inspired but skeptical. He dug into the research, found it was accurate, and wrote a book on the subject: *More from Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using Fewer Resources --- And What Happens Next* ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45008586-more-from-less)).

## Examples cited

-   "Among the more than 70 minerals, metals, and other resources long tracked by the US Geological Survey, only six haven't yet begun to decline in use. Consumption of steel, aluminum, and copper is down around 15%, 32%, and 40%, respectively, from peak levels." ==Temple, James. [The Planet Has a Fever, and the Cure Is More Capitalism, a Prominent Researcher Argues](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613845/the-planet-has-a-fever-and-the-cure-is-more-capitalism-a-prominent-economist-argues/). MIT Technology Review. 20 Jun 2019. Retrieved 15 Nov 2019.==
-   Timber in US: reducing both per capita, and in yearly total. 20-30% less than 1990. US peak paper was 1990 (2013 global), and we're down 40% from there. Cardboard use is the same as 1995.
-   Aluminum cans: used to one 4-5x heavier.
-   US energy use: in 2018 was only 0.25% more than 2007. Economy is bigger, but energy use has flatlined.
-   US crop tonnage: going up, while fertilizer, water and land use goes down.

## Enabling forces

-   **Efficiencies** driven by capitalism
-   **Technological progress** that has allowed us to "dematerialize" consumption.
-   **Public awareness** of environmental damage
-   **Responsive governments** that putt regulations in place to reduce those harms

## Criticisms

-   Trends don't matter; Thresholds do.

    -   "When you're dealing with systems that have thresholds ... actually these systems don't care about trends; they care about aggregate impacts." - Victor Galaz. ==Temple, James. [The Planet Has a Fever, and the Cure Is More Capitalism, a Prominent Researcher Argues](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613845/the-planet-has-a-fever-and-the-cure-is-more-capitalism-a-prominent-economist-argues/). MIT Technology Review. 20 Jun 2019. Retrieved 15 Nov 2019.==

-   Decreases in consumption may just mask shifts. In a tightly linked global economy, it's difficult to untangle overall resource use.

    -   E.g. Less farm land in US, because it's moved overseas.
    -   E.g. Less metals use, because products are being made in China.
    -   "Is it really all decoupling, or is some of it displacement into other parts of the word?" ==Temple, James. [The Planet Has a Fever, and the Cure Is More Capitalism, a Prominent Researcher Argues](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613845/the-planet-has-a-fever-and-the-cure-is-more-capitalism-a-prominent-economist-argues/). MIT Technology Review. 20 Jun 2019. Retrieved 15 Nov 2019.==

-   Declining trends in resource usage could be hangover from the Great Recession. ==Temple, James. [The Planet Has a Fever, and the Cure Is More Capitalism, a Prominent Researcher Argues](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613845/the-planet-has-a-fever-and-the-cure-is-more-capitalism-a-prominent-economist-argues/). MIT Technology Review. 20 Jun 2019. Retrieved 15 Nov 2019.==

-   Small gains in developing nations could be offset by growing appetites of emerging economies. ==Temple, James. [The Planet Has a Fever, and the Cure Is More Capitalism, a Prominent Researcher Argues](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613845/the-planet-has-a-fever-and-the-cure-is-more-capitalism-a-prominent-economist-argues/).

## Appealing hypothesis to the tech industry!

This was Marc Andreessen's [editorial review](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5GPMTY) of More from Less:

> In More from Less Andrew McAfee conclusively demonstrates how environmentalism requires more technology and capitalism, not less. Our modern technologies actually dematerialize our consumption, giving us higher human welfare with lower material inputs. This is an urgently needed and clear-eyed view of how to have our technological cake and eat it too.

And Reid Hoffman's:

> I've always believed that technological progress and entrepreneurship make our lives better. Here, Andrew McAfee shows how these powerful forces are helping us make our planet better too, instead of degrading it. For anyone who wants to help create a future that is both sustainable and abundant, this book is essential reading
