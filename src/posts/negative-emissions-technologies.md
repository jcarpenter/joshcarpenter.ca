[TODO: Read Capital article on UVIC carbon capture tech]{.todo}.

Technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Appealing because they promise the ability to avert climate change without changing our behavior (transforming the global economy, phasing out fossil fuels, etc)

> "Of 400 IPCC emissions models that land us below 2° Celsius, 344 feature negative emissions, most of them significantly" ==Wallace-Wells, David. [The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uninhabitable_Earth_(book)). New York: Tim Duggan Books. 2019. 169.==

## Natural

Revitalized forests. New agriculture practices.

## Technological

Under one model, each capture machine would be complexity of a car and \$30,000. ==Wallace-Wells, David. [The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uninhabitable_Earth_(book)). New York: Tim Duggan Books. 2019. 170.==

-   To match current carbon emitted and buy us some time: 100 million devices, \$30 trillion
-   To reduce atmospheric carbon by a few PPM: 500 million, \$150 trillion.
-   To reduce atmospheric carbon by 20 PPM / year, and immediately pull us back from the threshold: 1 billion devices, \$300 trillion.

## BECCS

Bioenergy and Carbon Capture and Storage.

1.  Grow massive tree plantations around the world.
2.  They absorb CO2.
3.  We harvest the trees and convert them into pellets.
4.  We burn the pellets in power stations for energy.
5.  We capture the emitted CO2 and store it underground.

Critiques ==Hickel, Jason. [The Paris Agreement Is Deeply Flawed - It's Time for a New Deal](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/paris-agreement-deeply-flawed-time-deal-180316115219671.html). Al Jazeera. 16 Mar 2018. Retrieved 5 Oct 2019.==

-   It's never been proven at scale.
-   It would require a third of the world's arable land (2-3x the size of India!). Making it impossible to feed the world.
-   It would reduce biodiversity, drive water and soil depletion, etc.
-   If we operated within safe margins, it only captures max 1% annual global emissions.

## Open Ocean Fertilization

See:

-   Tollefson, Jeff. "Iron-dumping ocean experiment sparks controversy." Nature. 23 May 2017. <https://www.nature.com/news/iron-dumping-ocean-experiment-sparks-controversy-1.22031>

The 2019 IPCC Oceans and Cryosphere's report casts doubt on the impact of these approaches. ==[The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate](https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/home/). Geneva, Switzerland: IPCC. 25 Sep 2019. 5--10.==

> The feasibility of climate mitigation by open ocean fertilization of productivity is limited to negligible, due to the likely decadal-scale return to the atmosphere of nearly all the extra carbon removed, associated difficulties in carbon accounting, risks of unintended side effects and low acceptability. Other human interventions to enhance marine carbon uptake, e.g., ocean alkalinisation (enhanced weathering), would also have governance challenges, with the increased risk of undesirable ecological consequences (high confidence).

## Criticism of NETs: they are risky and unproven, and being used by global leaders as an excuse to delay critical cuts to growth and consumerism

The critique: We cannot avoid emissions reductions (10% reduction by rich nations per year). NET have a role to play, but a small one. Success will ultimately require slowing growth and consumerism. But leaders are desperate to avoid that, so they lean on technology solutions. ==Hickel, Jason. [The Paris Agreement Is Deeply Flawed - It's Time for a New Deal](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/paris-agreement-deeply-flawed-time-deal-180316115219671.html). Al Jazeera. 16 Mar 2018.

### Paper by European Academies' Science Advisory Council summarizes the pushback:

From the [summary](https://easac.eu/news/details/climate-change-wont-be-solved-by-removing-excess-co2-from-atmosphere/) of their report: [ Negative emission technologies: What role in meeting Paris Agreement targets ](https://easac.eu/fileadmin/PDF_s/reports_statements/Negative_Carbon/EASAC_Report_on_Negative_Emission_Technologies.pdf):

> Negative emissions technologies (NETs) -- new technologies that aim to remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere -- have "limited realistic potential" in meeting the Paris Agreement targets,

> ...none of the NETs mentioned in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models can be deployed fast enough or can remove the gigatons of carbon that would be necessary.

> The IPCC scenarios are highly dependent on the successful deployment of NETs. Of the scenarios listed in the IPCC database, the report notes that 344 of 400 -- 86 per cent -- of the scenarios that have a 50 per cent or better chance of meeting the Paris Agreement targets rely on "successful and large-scale deployment" of negative emissions technologies.

> ...large-scale deployment of NETs "would result in high economic costs and likely major impacts on terrestrial or marine ecosystems."

> The academies call for climate change mitigation efforts to be strengthened instead of relying on these (future) technologies

NET *will* have a role, but at smaller scale:

> Nevertheless, the report notes that NETs may still have a useful role to play in addressing climate change, albeit at a smaller scale. The feasibility of implementing these technologies is likely to be location-, technology-, and circumstance-specific.
