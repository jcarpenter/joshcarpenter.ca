## Complexity can lead to paralysis in the face of change, and then collapse

Per Clay Shirky’s seminal 2010 essay, [The Collapse of Complex Business Models](http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/04/the-collapse-of-complex-business-models/):

> “When the value of complexity turns negative, a society plagued by an inability to react remains as complex as ever, right up to the moment where it becomes suddenly and dramatically simpler,  which is to say right up to the moment of collapse. Collapse is simply the last remaining method of simplification."  

Draws from 1998 Joseph Tainter book “The Collapse of Complex Societies”. Seems to share core observation with Clay Christensen and disruption theory.

When radical change comes, and undermines incumbent models, incumbents are rarely able to successfully respond, because 1) they are not incentivized to, and 2) they lack the cultural capacity to.

Christensen identified the sources of challenge as 1) low-end disruption, and 2) new market disruption. 

Tainter’s contribution to the theory is that complexity itself can be a driver of collapse. The complexity of the system benefits an elite who are not incentivized to simplify. And even if they want to simplify, the rigidity of the complex interlocking system makes it extremely difficult to change. It becomes “easier” to start from scratch. Which is simplification through collapse. 

## Complex systems have key leverage points

Donella Meadows, in [Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System](http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/), lists the following **leverage points**; places in complex systems (states, corporations, economies, etc) where small shifts can produce large changes.

1. The power to transcend paradigms.
2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.
3. The goals of the system.
4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.
5. The rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).
6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).
7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.
8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.
9. The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change.
10. The structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).
11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.
12. Constants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).

## It's rarely clear how we should manipulate these leverage points. 

Because the systems in which they sit are inherently complex, with many factors interacting. She gives growth as an example. Growth is identified by Jay Forrester as leverage point for poverty, hunger, environmental destruction, resource depletion, unemployment, etc. But simply increasing growth isn’t won't have the outcomes we desire. Because growth has own costs: inequality, hunger, environmental destruction, etc. Growth _is_ an important leverage point, but how we manipulate it is another question. In some cases we need slower growth, different kinds of growth, or even zero to negative growth. 

### Changing mindsets and paradigms is one of the most powerful leverage points

How do we you change mindsets and paradigms? Thomas Kuhn, who wrote a seminal book about the [great paradigm shifts of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions), and says that the formula in a nutsell is:

1. Keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm
2. Keep speaking louder and with assurance from the new one
3. Insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power. 
4. Don’t waste time with reactionaries; rather work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.

## Gall’s Law

Related: [Gall’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall.27s_law). A rule of thumb for systems design, from John Gall’s book, _Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail_:

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

Is an argument in favor of underspecification. The web, blogging, Twitter, etc are examples.
