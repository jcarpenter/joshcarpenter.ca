## Confirmed cases in Canada


Number of confirmed cases per province, sampled daily from the Government of Canada's [COVID-19: Outbreak Update](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html#a1) site. RPT stands for "repatriated travellers".

Chart inspired by Maclean's excellent article, [Coronavirus in Canada](https://www.macleans.ca/society/health/coronavirus-in-canada-these-charts-show-how-our-fight-to-flatten-the-curve-is-going/), which contains multiple charts capturing different aspects of COVID-19's spread in Canada. I wanted to see if I could create a dynamic, automatically-updating web version of their static images charts.

## Cumulative deaths per country

Per [John Burn-Murdoch](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/) of the Financial Times, [Mar 20](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1241091873621643266):

![Cumulative COVID-10 deaths, by country](/img/climate/covid19-infection-rates.jpg "Chart showing cumulative COVID-10 deaths, by country")

## 30-70% could become infected

-   2/3 Germans could be infected. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-author' title='Authors'>Bennhold, Katrin, & Eddy, Melissa.</span> <span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/world/europe/coronavirus-merkel-germany.html'>Merkel Gives Germans a Hard Truth About the Coronavirus</a>.</span> <span class='cite-container' title='Newspaper'>The New York Times.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>11 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==

## In America, that could translate into 1.6 million dead

-   360 million Americans, 50% infection, 1% mortality = 1.6 million.
-   Note: Italy is seeing more like 6% mortality. But US (I've read) has more ICU beds. But the US is has weaker safety net (i.e. more poor people who can't afford to stay home from work), and does not have socialized health care (some more may avoid treatment).
-   1% fatality rate would be 10x the flu. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==
-   (Assuming no drugs found effective and made available)

## Spread could take several years

-   1-2 years. Maybe longer. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-author' title='Authors'>Bennhold, Katrin, & Eddy, Melissa.</span> <span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/world/europe/coronavirus-merkel-germany.html'>Merkel Gives Germans a Hard Truth About the Coronavirus</a>.</span> <span class='cite-container' title='Newspaper'>The New York Times.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>11 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>.

-   It could subside in the summer, but come back strong in the fall. If it's seasonal (we don't yet know). This is what happened with the 1918 Spanish Flu.

## Once enough people have been infected, we get herd immunity

-   Can't catch something if enough people you are already immune (because they've already been sick).

## The primary risk is hospitals being overwhelmed

> ...the threshold is things such as ICU beds. If the epidemic is small enough, doctors can provide respiratory support to the significant fraction of patients who develop complications, and relatively few will die. But once the number of critical patients exceeds the number of ventilators and ICU beds and other critical-care facilities, mortality rates spike.

## The immediate goal is to "flatten the curve"

![Impact of protective measures](/img/climate/flatten-the-curve.png "Chart depicting two scenarios for infection numbers, with and without protective measures")

"Flattening the curve" means lowering the rate at which people are infected, to keep healthcare providers from being swamped (ala Italy), and to buy time until treatments can be developed. The broader goal being to lower mortality rates.

## We slow the spread by keeping people apart

Countries that keep people apart are slowing COVID-19 spread. E.g. Signapore, Hong Kong. Countries that are not, are seeing massive outbreaks. E.g. Iran, Italy, China.

Per Globe & Mail:

> Dr. Fisman said evidence shows countries that have adopted policies to keep people apart have been able to control the COVID-19 spread, while others, such as Iran, Italy and China, have faced massive outbreaks because of inaction. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-author' title='Authors'>Weeks, Carly.</span> <span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-between-30-and-70-per-cent-of-canadians-could-be-infected-with/'>Between 30 and 70 Per Cent of Canadians Could Become Infected with Coronavirus, Patty Hajdu Says</a>.</span> <span class='cite-container' title='Newspaper'>The Globe and Mail.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>11 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==

### Social distancing keeps people from getting infected

> "Social distancing means remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible." ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-author' title='Authors'>CDC.</span> <span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html'>Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>9 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==

### Isolation and quarantine keep sick people from spreading the illness

Per [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/3/21161232/coronavirus-usa-quarantine-isolation-social-distancing):

-   **Isolation** is separating those with confirmed infections from other people, so that they can get better without infecting anyone else.
-   **Quarantine** is restricting the movement of, or isolating, people who might have been exposed to an infection but who aren't yet sick.

## Social distancing will probably last until late April

Per Dr. Anthony Fauci (Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and member of the White House task force), on Mar 20:

> "If you look at the trajectory of the curves of outbreaks in other areas, it's at least going to be several weeks," Fauci told NBC "Today Show" host Savannah Guthrie. "I cannot see that all of a sudden, next week or two weeks from now, it's going to be over," he continued. "I don't think there's a chance of that. I think it's going to be several weeks." ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-author' title='Authors'>Cabrera, Cristina.</span> <span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/fauci-predict-americans-quarantines-several-weeks'>Fauci Predicts Americans Will Need to Remain at Home for "at Least" Several Weeks</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>20 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 20 Mar 2020.</span></span>==

## How is it transmitted?

TODO: Mar 20: Refresh with latest information.

In terms of likelihood, per Michael Osterholm: ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw'>JRE \#1439 - Michael Osterholm</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>Recorded 10 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 20 Mar 2020.</span></span>==

1.  Aerosol transmission
2.  Hand to mouth / face
3.  Fecal oral

Virus lasts 4-20 hrs on surfaces (maybe few days), depending on type. No consensus yet, though. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==

## How long are we infectious?

TODO: Mar 20: Refresh with latest information.

-   Can be infectious before symptoms appear.
-   "We currently think folks are infectious 2 days before, through 14 days after onset of symptoms (T-2 to T+14 onset)". ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==

## What if we get sick?

If you're under 70, and don't have lung or cardio-vascular problems:

-   Stay at home, socially isolate, treat the symptoms.
-   *"There is very little you can do at a hospital that you couldn't do at home. Most cases are mild. But if they are old or have lung or cardio-vascular problems, read on."* ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==

If you're 70+, and/or have lung or cardio-vascular problems:

-   Take them to the ER
-   Also do this if: you're having trouble breathing, or fever is very high and unmanaged with meds. TODO: Citation needed.

At the hospital:

-   COVID-19 causes primary pneumonia in a significant number of cases. Requires ICU to survive. Many patients need to stay on mechanical ventilators as long as 4 weeks. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-author' title='Authors'>Gale, Jason.</span> <span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-23/coronavirus-patients-long-ventilator-stays-strain-hospitals'>Coronavirus Patients' Long Ventilator Stays Put Strain on Hospitals</a>.</span> <span class='cite-container' title='Newspaper'>Bloomberg.com.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>23 Feb 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>. "More than two-thirds of critically ill patients required invasive breathing support, doctors at the Jin Yintan hospital in the central Chinese city of Wuhan found in a study of 52 such cases at the outbreak's epicenter."==
-   There is no accepted treatment yet.
-   Hospital will give supportive care (IV fluids, oxygen, etc) to help patient stay alive, while their body fights the disease.
-   If someone is high risk (both old, and has lung or cardio issues), they may be able to enroll for compassionate use of Remdesivir, a drug currently in clinical trials at UCSF and in China. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==

## How does testing work?

-   PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test. The only test that can distinguish COVID-19 from other dozen respiratory bugs currently circulating. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==
-   PCR test requires kits, and clinical labs to process those kits. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==
-   Kits are becoming more available, but lab capacity is not growing. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==
-   The leading firms---Quest and Labcore---have 1000 kit/day capacity. For the entire US. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==
-   Universities like UCSF, UCBerkeley and UWashington have donated research labs to help process kits. But capacity is only 20-40 kits/day. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==

## What should we do to prepare?

Buy the same medications and follow the same procedures that you would for a typical bad respiratory bug like bronchitis or pneumonia:

-   Acetominophen/Paracetamol (e.g. Tylenol) and Ibuprofen (e.g. Advil). Alternate every 4 hours.
-   Mucinex
-   Cough medicine. E.g. Robitussin, DayQuil/NyQuil.
-   Humidifer (can also turn on hot shower and sit in bathroom, or make pot of steaming water).
-   Thermometer
-   Kleenex

Stockpile critical prescription meds. Many supply chains run through China. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>==

Pneumonia shot may be helpful. Doesn't prevent COVID-19, but reduces chance of being weakened, which makes COVID-19 more dangerous. For same reason, get flu shot next fall. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v74KlOuKNgeoKCrN4poZjvzcJq5Lp0HqdLolGoc2OIo/edit?usp=sharing&usp=embed_facebook'>UCSF COVID-19 Panel Notes</a>.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>12 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 13 Mar 2020.</span></span>== TODO: Find another citation for this.

## Is Ibuprofen safe?

Expert consensus as of Mar 20 is that there is little hard evidence of ibuprofen worsening COVID-19. ==<span class='citation' title='Citation' aria-label='Citation'><span class='cite-author' title='Authors'>Szklarski, Cassandra.</span> <span class='cite-title' title='Title'><a href='https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-no-concrete-evidence-ibuprofen-makes-covid-19-worse-canadian-health/'>No Concrete Evidence Ibuprofen Makes COVID-19 Worse: Canadian Health Experts</a>.</span> <span class='cite-container' title='Newspaper'>The Globe and Mail.</span> <span class='cite-issued' title='Issued'>19 Mar 2020.</span> <span class='cite-accessed' title='Accessed'>Retrieved 20 Mar 2020.</span></span>== The WHO tweeted on Mar 18: "Based on currently available information, WHO does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen." And the FDA released a [statement](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-advises-patients-use-non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs-nsaids-covid-19) Mar 19 saying, "At this time, FDA is not aware of scientific evidence connecting the use of NSAIDs, like ibuprofen, with worsening COVID-19 symptoms."

Ibuprofen concerns arose when the French health minister [tweeted on Mar 14](https://twitter.com/olivierveran/status/1238776545398923264) that, "taking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone . . .) could be an aggravating factor for the infection. If you have a fever, take paracetamol".
