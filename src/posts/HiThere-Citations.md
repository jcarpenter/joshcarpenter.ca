## Preface

### How do we define "sea level rise"?

"Sea level rise" most commonly refers to *changes in the global mean sea level (GMSL)*, which is the **mean height** of the ocean surface as measured from the center of the earth.[^1]

#### It's tricky

Estimates of future sea level from <http://google.com> rise are typically expressed as relative to the mean of the 1986-2000 period. For example, in the following graph showing sea level rise since 1900, the zero point on the Y-axis is the 1986-2000 mean.[^2] IPCC projections (e.g.Â 0.52 - 0.98 m by 2100) are also relative to the 1986-2000 mean.[^3]

#### IPCC AR5 report said:

> Ocean thermal expansion and glacier melting have been the dominant contributors to 20th century global mean sea level rise.[^4] Observations since 1971 indicate that thermal expansion and glaciers (excluding Antarctic glaciers peripheral to the ice sheet) explain 75% of the observed rise. ... The contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has increased since the early 1990s, partly from increased outflow induced by warming of the immediately adjacent ocean.

### Sea level rise is accelerating

GMSL rise average (mm/year):

-   1901-2010 - 1.7 mm
-   1997-2006 - 3.04 mm
-   2007-2016 - 4.36 mm
-   2014-2019 - 5 mm

#### But that's not necessarily a bad thing

The trigger for this process is ice shelve breakup. Ice shelves float on the surface of the ocean, forming a buttress around the edge of the grounded ice mass. As the atmosphere and ocean warm, they accelerate the breakup of ice shelves, which eventually advances the grounding line beneath the ice mass to the point where it is traveling down the slope of the bowl of the marine ice sheet.
