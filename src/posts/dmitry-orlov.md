Lives on a sailboat w/ wife. Engineer by training, he earns living through consulting and developing own IP (e.g.Â books) remotely. Offers lessons from Soviet Union on living successfully with collapse.

Ignore his reasons for "why" he thinks collapse will happen (he gets carried away with hate for US, and also has very right wing Russian ideas about multiculturalism, homosexuality, etc). Focus on his tactics and learning from USSR.

## Quick capture

From his [Long Now talk](http://longnow.org/seminars/02009/feb/13/social-collapse-best-practices/):

Food. Shelter. Transportation. Security.

Focus on hard skills. Things you can do with your hand, with tools you own.

Befriend people with guns. Police, soldiers, etc. There will be lots of them around, as well as former prisoners and criminals, and you'll need them for security.

Ethnic mafias do well. High level of cohesion, and unique language provides inherent secrecy barrier. Ala Chechen mafia in Russia.

Russian women did well. They got on with life, the new rules of survival, etc. Russian men were more shell shocked. Drinking and lamenting the loss of the USSR.

Reduce burn rate and get comfortable with simpler life. Being poor takes practice. Collapse is harder on rich people. Better to start now. If you wait for the catastrophe, it will be too late.

Rural communities are poised to do well. They already live with simplicity, have hard skills, and community networks.

Foster community. You'll need each other. Rugged individualism on its own won't get you far.

Invest in concrete assets. Things you can use, things you can sell. Tools, fuel, food, bullets (his suggestion), etc.
