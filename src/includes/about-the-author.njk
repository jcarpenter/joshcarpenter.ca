    <p>I'm a user experience designer, based in Vancouver, Canada. Currently I am focused on  learning more about climate change, and building a Markdown editor. Most recently I led design teams at <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a>, working to bring virtual and augmented reality to the open web.</p>
