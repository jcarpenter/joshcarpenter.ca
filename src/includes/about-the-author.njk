                I'm a user experience designer based in Vancouver, Canada. Most recently I led design teams at Google and Mozilla, working to bring virtual and augmented reality to the open web. My experience is a mix of product leadership, interaction design, visual design, motion graphics, programming and community engagement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox">A fox&#8212;not a hedgehog</a>. Since 2019 I've been traveling and working on a series of personal projects, including an Electron-based Markdown editor and a deep dive into climate change.
