I was particularly passionate about exploring how classic two-dimensional web sites might be progressively enhanced into 3D space. What if a 360 background could be added with a meta tag, for example, or elements positioned around the user with CSS 3D transforms? I created a series of prototypes that explored the potential, using combinations of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), CSS, and Cinema 4D. These ideas were shared in a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpcgcVwvUgA) I gave at the 2016 W3C Workshop on Web and Virtual Reality ^[The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CSgOsiyn2PeLGlJCnrmmTYv9FLE_dmCaVKp7fZ-SF2I/edit?usp=sharing) from that talk.], and eventually led to the [A-Frame](/aframe/) project.
