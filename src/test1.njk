        <p class="hanging-punctuation">“Sea level rise” most commonly refers to changes in the <strong>global mean sea level</strong> (GMSL), which is the mean height of the ocean surface as measured from the center of the earth.</p>
        <p>Estimates of future sea level rise are typically expressed as relative to the mean of the 1986-2000 period. For example, in the following graph showing sea level rise since 1900, the zero point on the Y-axis is the 1986-2000 mean. IPCC projections (e.g. 0.52 - 0.98 m by 2100) are also relative to the 1986-2000 mean.</p>

        <p>If the ground below the marine ice sheets slopes downwards the further inland it goes (<em>reverse bed slope</em>), the grounding line accelerates as it moves forward.

        <p>The trigger for this process is ice shelve breakup. Ice shelves float on the surface of the ocean, forming a buttress around the edge of the grounded ice mass. As the atmosphere and ocean warm, they accelerate the breakup of ice shelves, which eventually advances the grounding line beneath the ice mass to the point where it is traveling down the slope of the bowl of the marine ice sheet.</p>
        <p>This process would hit West Antarctica hardest, as it has large marine ice sheets.</p>

        <p>This is a newer hypothesis, and still being debated. The idea is intuitive: ice cliffs higher than 90 meters collapse due to the physics of ice. The collapse process will accelerate if the ice mass gets thicker the further back it goes (as most do), as the ice collapsing at the edge of the mass reveals ever-higher, faster-collapsing ice behind.</p>

          <p>Sea level projections show regional differences around GMSL. Processes not driven by recent climate change, such as local subsidence caused by natural processes and human activities, are important to relative sea level changes at the coast (high confidence). While the relative importance of climate-driven sea level rise is projected to increase over time, local processes need to be considered for projections and impacts of sea level (high confidence). <button class="focusable">fn</button><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/home/">The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate</a>.

        <p>In the 2014 IPCC report, it was understood that Antarctica would be an increasingly important driver of sea level rise going forward, but it was felt that models of ice sheet breakup were too uncertain to incorporate into GMSL projections. Since then, we have 1) observed accelerating Antarctic melting, and 2) learned more about the processes by which ice sheets break up. And so newer reports are more confidently incorporating Antarctic melting into their projections. For example, compare the 2014 and 2019 IPCC reports:</p>
        <p>2014 AR5:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>There is low confidence in the available models’ ability to project solid ice discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet. Hence, these models likely underestimate the Antarctica ice sheet contribution. <button class="focusable">fn</button><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/">Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report</a>.

          <p>Mean sea level rise projections are higher by 0.1 m compared to AR5 under RCP8.5 in 2100, and the likely range extends beyond 1 m in 2100 due to a larger projected ice loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (medium confidence) <button class="focusable">fn</button><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/home/">The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate</a>.

        <p>In general, IPCC reports tend towards more conservative projections, in part because they reflect the consensus opinion of many authors.</p>
        <h2 id="my-estimate-for-sea-level-rise-035-m-by-2050">My estimate for sea level rise: 0.35 m by 2050. <a class="header-anchor" href="#my-estimate-for-sea-level-rise-035-m-by-2050">¶</a></h2>
        <p>Melt rates seem to be accelerating. World Meteorological Society figures from September 2019 are: annual GMSL rise of <strong>3.04 mm</strong> for 1997-2006 and <strong>4.36</strong> for 2007-2016. That’s a <strong>1.43x</strong> decade-over-decade multiplier. If we extrapolate that out over the century, we get the following rates for ten decades of (figures rounded to first decimal place): <strong>3, 4.3, 6.2, 8.9, 12.7, 18.2, 26, 37.2, 53.2, 76</strong> (mm / year). Which translates into the following estimates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>0.35</strong> m by 2050</li>
          <li><strong>2.45</strong> m by 2100</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That seems reasonable to me. It is greater than the (outdated and conservative) IPCC AR5 worst-case figures, but also below Richard Alley’s worst case 4.5-6.0 estimate. On his scenario probability graph, my estimate sits about 75% along the x-axis.</p>

        <p>The heat already in the ocean will continue to drive sea level rise, even if we could magically stop all emissions today. But we still need to rapidly reduce emissions, because the hotter the world is, the more sea level rise we will see, and the faster it will happen.</p>
