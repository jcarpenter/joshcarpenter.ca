        <p class="hanging-punctuation">“Sea level rise” most commonly refers <button class="focusable">fn</button> to changes in the <strong>global mean sea level</strong> (GMSL), which is the mean height of the ocean surface as measured from the center of the earth.</p>
        <p>Estimates of future sea level rise are typically expressed as relative to the mean of the 1986-2000 period. For example, in the following graph showing sea level rise since 1900, the zero point on the Y-axis is the 1986-2000 mean. <button class="focusable">fn</button> IPCC projections (e.g. 0.52 - 0.98 m by 2100) are also relative to the 1986-2000 mean.</p>
