## Overview

The report assesses the likelihood and impact of 15 climate risk events in the 2050’s, under RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration levels. 

* RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathway) are a trajectories of potential future greenhouse gas concentrations. They are what the IPCC uses for their [fifth Assessment Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC_Fifth_Assessment_Report) (2014).
* RCP8.5 is “a high estimate of future growth in greenhouse gas concentrations”. 
* Which we’re on track for: 2018 concentrations of greenhouse has are in line with RCP8.5. 
* And even if we hit lower RCP levels (4.5, 2.6), “there will be little discernible difference in climate impacts in 2050 between the RCPs”. Per the chart below:

### The report’s process [@rep-PreliminaryStrategic-GBC-19, p.10-11]

1. Identified 15 “provincially significant” risk events. 
	1. More regional risks are not included.
2. Evaluated the likelihood and consequences of each.
3. Created a risk matrix for the events, based on the above.

### Important caveats to bear in mind while reading

* Scenarios could be both less and more severe
* Scenarios are designated as either _discrete_, or _ongoing_.
* Scenario “2050 risk” ranking is actually for 2040-2059.
* Other scenarios are possible, beyond what’s in the report. In particular, regional risks.
* Cascading or compound events with multiplicative impacts are probable, but not deeply researched in this first report.

## Questions for to self…

* Supply chain vulnerabilities. What network branches are particularly vulnerable? Which communities? E.g. Highways and train lines. Coastal communities. 
* For the highest risk items, what are the details?
* What water sources are available?
* What temperature level do we expect? What is the equivalent current-day latitude? E.g. Northern California. What are the probable consequences for what grows here, what animal species thrive, etc.

* Effects: What are the probable effects for BC?
* Smoke: Where is likely to be worst?
* Heat: What does BC heat map look like over time?
* Ports and Ferries: What are their adaptation plans for sea level rise?
* Supply chains: Where are the chokepoints?
* Preparedness: What plans, funds, services (etc) are in place?

## Quick captures:

* BC Contingency Reserve Fund is $1.5 billion. [@rep-PreliminaryStrategic-GBC-19, p.18]

## High level take aways

![Summary of Risk Assessment Rankings [@rep-PreliminaryStrategic-GBC-19, p.4]](img/bc-climate-risks-4101909.png)

* **Severe wildfire season** and **seasonal water shortages** are the two highest risks (ranked as likely, and high-to-extreme consequence). They would also have compounding effects.
* **Heat wave**, **ocean acidification**, **fires mass loss**, and **long-term water shortage** are also ranked as high risk.

## Predicted climate changes for BC

Heat

* More heat waves (\>32°C).
* 1.8°C increase in annual mean temperatures by 2050 (relative to a historical baseline of 1971-1990)
* Dramatic reduction in springtime (April 1) snowpack volume. 
* Effects most pronounced in regions already hit by water shortages. Southern BC, Interior Plateau, low-lying valleys in Columbia Mountains. Climate Moisture Index (CMI) deficits expected to increase by approx 200% by 2080, relative to historical baseline of 1981-2000.

Precipitation

* 6% annual precipitation increase. 1% decrease in summer precipitation.
* More frequent and severe “heavy precipitation events”, driven by higher water vapor concentrations.

Results

* Double number of large wildfires (\> 200 ha) though 2080, assuming RCP8.5
* Larger and more varied number of regions experiencing wildfires, water shortages and landslides than traditionally.

## Compound effects

Climate events can both cascade (one increases likelihood of another) and compound (additive impact). 

### Most likely for BC

The highest risk compound effect for BC is Heat wave \> Water shortage \> Wildfire \> Landslides after rain. Water shortage dries the plants. Wildfire burns the plants. Plants are gone (weakened slope support), and soil is made more hydrophobic (increasing run off). Next rain fall, landslide occurs.

Exactly what happened in California: [@rep-PreliminaryStrategic-GBC-19, p.103-104]

* 2012-2017: historic drought. Extreme water shortages.
* Wildfires in 2016/17. E.g. Thomas wildfire, December 2017. Destroyed 1063 structures, cleared land of vegetation. 
* Then in January, coincidental massive rainstorm. 25% of the average annual rainfall in 11 days. Triggered landslides in Montecito that killed 21 and injured 161.

Can also exacerbate drinking water shortages. Wildfire introduces ash, and/or a landslide introduces sediment, organic matter, and human contaminants.

Other examples

* Wildfires \> Soot onto glaciers \> Increases melt \> Downstream flooding in mountain fed watersheds. 

Most likely to be effected: Interior Plateau. 

* High risk for wildfire and water shortage
* High risk for access and utility cutoff from landslides. The following run through landslide-prone territory: Highways 5, 1, and 16, railways, and BC Hydro transmission infrastructure. 

## Random notes

California vs BC climate: 
BC has _“…more frequent and smaller-magnitude precipitation events… whereas California’s Mediterranean climate is more susceptible to episodic dry spells and atmospheric river-type precipitation events”_ [@rep-PreliminaryStrategic-GBC-19, p.104]

Mudslides. Montecito was 20mph. Many of those killed lived in areas that were under voluntary evacuation orders, because officials didn’t believe the mudslides would travel as far as they did. Mud deposited was 20ft high. 

Watersheds. Vulnerable to climate. Wildfire introduces ash. Landslides introduce sediment, organic matter, human contaminants. Into watersheds already depleted by drought.

Landslides can dam rivers, leading to severe flooding outside typical floodplains. _“In 2014, a landslide in Oso, Washington, dammed the North Fork Stillaguamish River and formed a lake 2.5 miles long, flooding homes.”_ [@rep-PreliminaryStrategic-GBC-19, p.109]
